Following \cite{christodoulopoulos-goldwater-steedman:2011:EMNLP} we
evaluate our model on languages of the MULTEXT-East\cite{Multext}
multilingual corpora and the CoNLL-X\cite{conll} shared task.  The
test set consists of 8 languages from Multext-East(Bulgarian, Czech,
English, Estonian, Hungarian, Romanian, Slovene and Serbian) and 10
languages the CoNLL-X shared task(Bulgarian, Czech, Danish, Duch,
German, Portuguese, Slovene, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish).  During
testing we only use the training section of each language data sets
\cite{Lee:2010:STU:1870658.1870741} and the Penn Treebank WSJ English
corpus is used as the development set.

Languages of Multext-East corpora do not tag the punctuation marks,
thus we add an extra tag for punctuation for these languages.  The
number of word types and clusters of each language are summarized in
Table~\ref{multiresults}.

\subsection{Substitute Vectors}
To calculate substitute probabilities, we trained language models
using the Wikipedia dump files \cite{wikipedia} of the target
languages as it is detailed in Section~\ref{sec:lm}.  The word count
of Wikipedia dump files vary across the languages to standartize the
process we set the unknown word threshold 2 for all languages.  As a
results we only replaced the words that are observed less than 2 times
in the language model training data(language model statistics are
detailed in Appendix~\ref{app-datax}).

\subsection{Features}
We use the same set of ortographic features described in
Section~\ref{sec:feat} except we add an extra ``Only-Punctuation''
feature to the languages of MULTEXT-EAST corpora.  The
``Only-Punctuaion'' is generated when a token contains only
punctuation.  

Morphological feature of each language is extracted by the method
described in Section~\ref{sec:feat}.  The number of suffix types are
summarized in Appendix~\ref{morpho}.

\subsection{Results}

We perform experiments with a range of languages and three different
feature setups to establish the robustness of our model across
languages and to observe the effects of different features.  For each
language we report results: (1) without features(uPos), (2) with
ortographic features(uPos+O) and (3) ortographic and morphological
features(uPos+O+M).  In accord with our development set, we use the
best performing setup of Section~\ref{sec:exp}\footnote{In
  Section~\ref{sec:wordsub} the best result is achieved on a 25
  dimensional sphere with 64 substitutes.}.  As a baseline model we
chose the bigram version of S-Code described in
Section~\ref{sec:bigram} which is a very strong baseline compared to
the ones used in \cite{christodoulopoulos-goldwater-steedman}.
Table~\ref{multiresults} summarizes the \mto and \vm scores of bigram
model and our models together with the best published score on each
language.  

uPos significanlty outperforms the bigram baseline in both \mto and
\vm scores on 14 languages while bigram model performs better on
Romanian and Serbian.  Our featureless model achieves a better \mto
score than the best published model only on Bulgarian(M).  Upos+O and
Upos+O+M achieved the highest \mto scores on all languages of
MULTEXT-EAST corpora however they scored the highest \vm only on 3
languages.  The comparably low \vm scores can be explained by the
coarse tagset of MULTEXT-EAST languages and the tendency of our models
to construct cluster that are lack of completeness instead of
homogenity as it is detailed in Section~\ref{discuss}.


achieves higher \mto than the best published scores on 8 different
languages.
