\section{Algorithm}

In this section we describe the components of our algorithm and their
relationship with each other.  The algorithm predicts the syntactic
category of a word in a given context based on its substitutes.  In
other words first we construct the co-occurrence representation of
words and their substitutes with the help of a language model and then
map each value in the co-occurrence data to a corresponding embedding
on a $n$ dimensional sphere using the S-CODE algorithm.  After that we
apply k-means clustering to categorize the word embeddings by which we
induced the word categories.  In the next subsection we detail the
construction of co-occurrence representation of the input, in
Subsection~\ref{??} we explain the embedding calculation and finally
in Subsection~\ref{??} we describe the different ways of embedding
clustering.\todo{do we need subsections?}
