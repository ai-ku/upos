\section{Contributions}
\label{sec:contrib}

Our main contributions can be summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item We introduced substitute vectors as paradigmatic representations
  of word context and demonstrated their use in syntactic category
  acquisition on 19 corpora in 15 languages.
\item We demonstrated that using paradigmatic representations of word
  context and modeling co-occurrences of word and context types with
  the S-CODE learning framework give superior results when compared to
  a baseline bigram model.
\item We extended the S-CODE framework to incorporate morphological
  and orthographic features and improved the state-of-the-art
  many-to-one accuracy in unsupervised part-of-speech induction on 17
  out of 19 languages.
\item All our code and data, including the substitute vectors for the
  one million word Penn Treebank Wall Street Journal dataset and
  Multext-East and CoNLL-X shared task corpora are available at the
  authors' website at \mbox{\url{xxx.xxx.xxx}}.
