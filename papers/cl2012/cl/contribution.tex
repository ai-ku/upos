\section{Contributions}
\label{sec:contrib}

Our main contributions can be summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item We introduced substitute vectors as paradigmatic representations
  of word context and demonstrated their use in unsupervised part of
  speech induction on 19 corpora in 15 languages.
\item We demonstrated that using paradigmatic representations of word
  context and modeling co-occurrences of word and context types with
  the S-CODE learning framework give superior results when compared to
  a syntagmatic bigram model.
\item We extended the S-CODE framework to incorporate morphological
  and orthographic features and improved the state-of-the-art
  many-to-one accuracy in unsupervised part of speech induction on 17
  out of 19 corpora.
\item All our code and data, including the substitute vectors for the
  PTB, MULTEXT-East and CoNLL-X shared task corpora are available
  at the authors' website at \mbox{\url{xxx.xxx.xxx}}.
\end{itemize}
