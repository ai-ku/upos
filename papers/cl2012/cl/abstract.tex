%% We introduce a paradigmatic representation of word context and

%% typical syntagmatic representations of word context which consist of
%% properties of neighboring words, our paradigmatic representation
%% consists of substitute vectors: possible substitutes of the target
%% word and their probabilities.  When word contexts are clustered based
%% on their substitute vectors they reveal a grouping that largely match
%% the traditional part of speech boundaries with a many-to-one accuracy
%% of \collapseResult\% on a 45-tag 24K word test corpus.

We investigate paradigmatic representations of word context in the
domain of unsupervised part-of-speech induction.  Paradigmatic
representations of word context are based on potential substitutes of
a word in contrast to syntagmatic representations based on properties
of neighboring words.  We demonstrate paradigmatic representations
within two frameworks: (1) Context Clustering and (2) Co-occurance
Data Embedding .  In the former we cluster words based on their
substitute vectors without using any extra features and they reveal a
grouping that largely match the traditional part of speech boundaries.
In the latter we construct Euclidean co-occurrence embedding that
combines the paradigmatic context representation with the target word
and its morphological and orthographic features.  We compare our
results with the best published models and demonstrate significant
gains in many-to-one accuracy on 17 out of 19 corpora in 15 languages
achieving the 80\% many-to-one accuracy on the 1M word English WSJ
Penn Treebank corpus.
