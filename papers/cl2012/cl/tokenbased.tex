\section{POS Induction for Word Tokens}
\label{sec:tokens}

In this section, we extend the random-substitutes algorithm presented
earlier to perform POS induction for the word tokens rather than the
word types.  We use the same settings in the Section~\ref{sec:wordsub}
and generate word ($X$) -- random-substitute ($Y$) pairs as the input
to the S-CODE.  For each observed $X$ -- $Y$ pair in the S-CODE input,
corresponding 25-dimensional $\phi_x$ and $\psi_y$ embedding vectors
are concatenated to create a 50-dimensional representation.  The
resulting 50-dimensional vectors are clustered using the instance
weighted k-means algorithm with 128 restarts.  The process yields 64
cluster-ids (for every pair generated from word token's context) for
each word token's context.  The cluster-ids tokens are predicted by
the majority cluster-id of the corresponding pairs.  Ties for the
majority are broken randomly.  The many-to-one accuracy is
\wsxymto\ and the V-measure is \wsxyvm\ .

In order to demonstrate the merit in the token based POS induction, we
first define the gold-tag perplexity for the word types as following:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:tag-perp}
GP(w) = 2^{H(p_w)} = 2^{-\sum_{x} p_w(x)log_2 p_w(x)}
\end{equation}
Where $p_w$ is the gold POS tag distribution of the word type $w$ and
$H(p_w)$ is the entropy of the $p_w$ distribution.

\begin{tabular}{|@{ }l@{ }|@{ }l@{ }|@{ }l@{ }|}
\hline
Model & \specialcell{$GP < 1.75$\\$89\%$} & \specialcell{$GP \ge 1.75$\\$11\%$}\\

\hline
Substitutes(Tokens) & .7322 (.0079) & .4671 (.0174)\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:bins}
\end{table}

Gold-tag perplexity ($GP$) is used to determine the POS ambiguity of
the word types, relating how often a word type is associated with
different POS tags in the test corpus.  A $GP$ of 1 for a word type
$w$ indicates $w$ is associated with same POS tag throughout the test
corpus, meaning the word type $w$'s POS is unambiguous.  As the $GP$
increases ambiguity for the word types increases and poses a handicap
for induction models that limits tag variety for the word types.  To
display the limitations, we split the test corpus in two subsets: word
types with $GP$ less than 1.75 and word types with $GP$ equal or greater
than 1.75.  We performed \mto\ evaluation on the the whole test corpus
induction output and obtained the induced-tag -- gold-tag
mappings. Using the mappings obtained over the test corpus, we
evaluated the accuracy in the subsets.  Table~\ref{tab:bins} presents
the evaluation over the subsets.

\subsection{Paradigmatic vs Syntagmatic Representations of Word Context}

In order to compare the token clustering performance of the
paradigmatic and the syntagmatic context representations we use the
same 4 models defined in Section~\ref{sec:bigram}.  Following the
previous section we concatinate the 25-dimensional $\phi_x$ and
$\psi_y$ ($\psi_{y_{1}}$ and $\psi_{y_{2}}$ in the fourth model) embeddings of
the corresponding observed pairs (tuples in the fourth model) and
represent the first three models outputs with a 50-dimensional vectors
(75-dimensional vectors in the fourth model).  The resulting vectors
are clustered using k-means algorithm with 128 restarts.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:tag-perp}
GP(w) = 2^{H(p_w)} = 2^{-\sum_{x} p_w(x)log_2 p_w(x)}
\end{equation}
Where $p_w$ is the gold POS tag distribution of the word type $w$ and
$H(p_w)$ is the entropy of the $p_w$ distribution.
