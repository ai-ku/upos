\section{POS Induction for Word Tokens}
\label{sec:tokens}

In this section, we extend the random-substitutes algorithm presented
earlier to perform POS induction for the word tokens rather the than
word types.  We use the same settings in the Section~\ref{sec:wordsub}
and generate word ($X$) -- random-substitute ($Y$) pairs as the input
to the S-CODE.  For each observed $X$ -- $Y$ pair in the S-CODE input,
corresponding 25-dimensional $\phi_x$ and $\psi_y$ embedding vectors
are concatenated to create a 50-dimensional representation.  The
resulting 50-dimensional vectors are clustered using the instance
weighted k-means algorithm (with fewer restarts to accomodate the
input size).  The process yields 64 cluster-ids (for every pair
generated from word token's context) for each word token's context.
The word tokens' cluster-ids are predicted by the majority cluster-id
of the corresponding pairs.  Ties for the majority are broken
randomly.  The many-to-one accuracy is \wsxymto\ and the V-measure is
\wsxyvm\ .
