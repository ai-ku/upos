%%substitute vector applications
\subsection{Substitute Vector Applications}
\label{sec:subapp}
In this section, we explored the limits and potential of using solely
substitute vectors (without using the correponding target word
identities) on the part-of-speech induction problem.  Rest of this
section details the choice of the data set, the vocabulary and the
estimation of substitute probabilities.  


Section~\ref{sec:dist} gives a detailed comparison of similarity
metrics in high dimensional substitute vector space.
Section~\ref{sec:dimreduce} analyzes application of possible
dimensionality reduction algorithms to our problem.
Section~\ref{sec:clustering} gives comparison of various clustering
techniques and finally Section~\ref{sec:wsj} applies the findings of
the previous sections to the 1M word Penn Treebank corpus.
