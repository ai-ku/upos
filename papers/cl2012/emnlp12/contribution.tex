\section{Contributions}
\label{sec:contrib}

Our main contributions can be summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item We introduced substitute vectors as paradigmatic representations
  of word context and demonstrated their use in syntactic category
  acquisition.
\item We demonstrated that using paradigmatic representations of word
  context and modeling co-occurrences of word and context types with
  the S-CODE learning framework give superior results when compared to
  a baseline bigram model.
\item We extended the S-CODE framework to incorporate morphological
  and orthographic features and improved the state-of-the-art in
  unsupervised part-of-speech induction to 80\% many-to-one accuracy.
\item All our code and data, including the substitute vectors for the
  one million word Penn Treebank Wall Street Journal dataset, is
  available at the authors' website at \mbox{\url{http://goo.gl/RoqEh}}.
\end{itemize}
